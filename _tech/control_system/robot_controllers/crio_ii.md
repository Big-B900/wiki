The 2010 Robot Controller, the cRIO-FRC II, is the same CompactRIO ([cRIO](crio)) control system as it was in 2009. The difference was that this version had 4 slots, rather than the 8 with the cRIO-FRC, making it lighter and less expensive. The 2009 cRIO-FRC was still a legal controller until 2015, when the NI RoboRIO replaced the cRIO-FRC and cRIO-FRC II as the controller for FRC robots. The cRIO from National Instruments can be programmed in [LabVIEW](labview), C, C++, or Java.


## Programming

Code is cross-compiled on a separate computer then uploaded over the network by the programming environment.

## Modules
The cRIO-FRC II had slots for four interchangeable modules. New modules were supplied each year to teams. The modules by themselves only have a D-Sub connector, so PWM or other wiring connections are made available through a breakout board that either screws into the module (used with the NI 9201 and NI 9472 modules), or a sidecar that is seperate from the module and connected by a cable (used with the NI 9403 module).

There were three modules used:
* [Digital I/O Module (NI 9403)](/wiki/ni-9403)
* [Digital Output (Solenoid) Module (NI 9472)](/wiki/ni-9472)
* [Analog Input Module (NI 9201)](/wiki/ni-9201)
