The 2010 Robot Controller, the cRIO-FRC II, is the same CompactRIO ([cRIO](crio)) control system as it was in 2009. The difference was that this version had 4 slots, rather than the 8 with the cRIO-FRC, making it lighter and less expensive. The 2009 cRIO-FRC was still a legal controller until 2015, when the NI RoboRIO replaced the cRIO-FRC and cRIO-FRC II as the controller for FRC robots. The cRIO from National Instruments can be programmed in [LabVIEW](labview), C, C++, or Java.
