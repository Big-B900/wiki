The **Jaguar** is a [speed controller](speed-controller) developed by Luminary Micro and supplied by Texas Instruments. The Jaguar was added to the FIRST Robotics Competition in the 2009 season to supplement the [Victor 884](victor-884). It has had two different versions, the MDL-BDC "Grey Jaguar" and the MDL-BDC24 "Black Jaguar".


## Technical

The Jaguar is part of the FIRST [control system](Control_system "Control system" ). The Jaguar works by recieving a [PWM signal](pwm-signal) or [CAN](can) input from a [robot-controller](Robot_controller "Robot controller" ), which may include the (full) [Robot Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ), the [Robovation](Robovation "Robovation" ) controller or a [Vex](Vex "Vex" ) Controller. Depending on the range of the [PWM](PWM "PWM" ) signal - with 0 being full reverse, 127 being neutral, and 254 being full forward - the Victor 884 adjusts the such applications as [drivetrains](Drive_trains "Drive trains" ), arms, or elevators.

The nominal operating voltage of the MDL-BDC is 12 volts, while the MDL-BDC24 is capable of 24 volt operation as well. Both have a maximum operating current of 40 amps.
