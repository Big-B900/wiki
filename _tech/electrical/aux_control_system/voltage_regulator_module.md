{% include stub %}

The Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) is used mainly to power the robot's radio. Introduced in 2015, it replaced the DC/DC Power Converter. 
It can also be used to power custom circuits. It has power outputs of 12V/2A, 12V/500mA, 5V/2A and 5V/500mA.

## Connecting the Robot Radio

Some VRMs may have a "radio" sticker on the 5V/2A output label (mainly 2015 VRMs). This is because the D-Link radio used in 2015 used a 5V 
input. Current radios (OM5P-AN and OM5P-AC) use the **12V/2A** output.
