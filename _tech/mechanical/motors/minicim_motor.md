The MiniCIM is a smaller version of the CIM motor, with the same diameter and output shaft, but shorter and with 2/3 power. CIMs and MiniCIMs are interchangable on robot mechanisms, they will work together just fine.

MiniCIMs are sold by [VEX Robotics](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/all/217-3371.html "http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/all/217-3371.html") and [West Coast Products](http://www.wcproducts.net/motors "http://www.wcproducts.net/motors").
